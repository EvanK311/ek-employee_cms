## 1. Introduction {#description}
In this application, you will be able to create a table consisting of employees with their roles and departments and whether or not they have a manager or are a manager. You will also be able to insert their salary into the field to the corresponding role. The user will need to add a department and role before adding an employee to the table. After employees and roles are added, the user will be able to view tables containing each table containing information.
